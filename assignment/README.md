## STATE MANAGEMENT CHOICES

1. useState for Local Component State
    -Used in Counter.tsx to track the counter value.
    -Used in UserDataForm.tsx to track form data and detect unsaved changes.
    -Used in RichTextEditor.tsx to manage editor state (EditorState).

2. useEffect for Side Effects
    -UserDataForm.tsx uses useEffect to:
      -Load saved form data from localStorage.
      -Save form data to localStorage when changes occur.
      -Warn users about unsaved changes before leaving the page.
    -RichTextEditor.tsx uses useEffect to initialize editor state from localStorage.

3. localStorage for Persistence
    -UserDataForm.tsx and RichTextEditor.tsx store user input in localStorage, ensuring data persists across page reloads.
